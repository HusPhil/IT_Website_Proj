                </div>
                <p>The sun knew when to rise
                    The flowers knew when to bloom
                    And so, I envy the way of knowing
                    As I wonder the meaning
                    OF LIFE <br><br>
                    As a student I was enchanted to believe that life holds meaning.
                    But as I continue to this path, the more I struggle to keep on believing.
                    The stress, workload, and pressure keeps on growing.
                    Often still awake until the deep dusk, where frustration is the only dawning. <br><br>
                    Often I question myself, does life truly have meaning?
                    Does my effort, achievements, and suffering really matter?
                    Dark thoughts, sad thoughts, kept creeping in on my skin.
                    And I can't help but feel anxious as they swallow me from within. <br><br>

                    Still, I believe that from the bitterness of life comes its meaning.
                    That sadness cannot exist without joy.
                    That crying comes before laughing.
                    And with a context of a colorless life.
                    Exist one that is full of colors. <br> <br>

                    There exist a light of hope that guides on my destination.
                    We share the bitterness of achievements and the bitterness of failure.<br> <br>
                    
                    Life can be black and white but its meaning is somewhere in between,
                    and with cruelty of fate, I will keep on dancing.
                    for them, Because of them, even if meaningless, life is still worth living.</p>
